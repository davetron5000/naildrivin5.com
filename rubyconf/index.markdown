### Wed, Nov 15, 12:45pm @ Gold State Ballroom (Lunch)

You like coffee, right? <span role="img" aria-label="coffee cup">☕️</span> Let's see what kinda coffee we can bring together.

1. Bring a bag of beans from your favorite local roaster.  Fresher the better! Preferably *not* ground, since everyone has their own process.
1. Wednesday, Nov 15, at **12:45pm** in Golden State Ballroom (where they serve lunch), find <a href="#me">me</a> at a table. I will try to have a sign.
1. At **1:00pm**, we'll combine all the bags and randomly swap yours for someone else's by drawing numbers or something easy.
1. Feel free to swap after with others to refine your selection.
