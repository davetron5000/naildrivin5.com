I've been working on an in-browser interactive fiction/game for the last few years that I have finally decided is complete: [ Starlight Dawn][link]. It's a tile-based RPG in the vein of the old Ultima games.  It was made with Ruby and JavaScript.  You can play it right now, and your location is saved in your browser's local storage. There's no sign up or other requirement. Just start playing! You can also [follow on Mastodon](https://mastodon.art/@starlightdawn).
