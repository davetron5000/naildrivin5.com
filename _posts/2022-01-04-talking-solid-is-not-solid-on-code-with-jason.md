My [third appearance][link] on the [Code with Jason podcast](https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/), this time
talking about how SOLID is not so solid.  Snark level is between [the book](https://solid-is-not-solid.com) and my
[more serious takes](https://naildrivin5.com/blog/2019/11/11/solid-is-not-solid-rexamining-the-single-responsibility-principle.html).
