If you want to know how to sustainably manage background jobs in your Rails app, you should be using Sidekiq, and you should by
my book, [*Ruby on Rails Background Jobs with Sidekiq*][link]. $9.99, ebook only, a scant 70 pages.

Since 2011, I've been responsible for apps that had a *lot* of
background jobs, *and* I've been on-call for those apps.  Believe me when I tell you, you don't want to learn how to write
idempotent jobs, create self-healing retriable processes, or manage queues that way. It takes too long and its too stressful. Just read the book I wish I had back then.
