My first Rails job involved a lot of background jobs, and the year and a half I worked at
LivingSocial was, in many ways, a crucible of managing background jobs.  Today, the book
I wish I had been given at the time is now in Beta: "Ruby on Rails Background Jobs with
Sidekiq."

The book is tightly focused at under 70 pages. It's a pragmatic guide to using Sidekiq background jobs to make your app manageable without notification fatigue.  Putting code in a
background job is almost trivialâ€”making it fault tolerant, idempotent, and self-healing
is the hard part, and it requires care when designing your app's features.

This book is all about that.
