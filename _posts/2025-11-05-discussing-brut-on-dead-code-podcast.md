I recently got to chat with [Jared Norman](https://ruby.social/@jardo) on the [Dead Code Podcast][link]. We talked mostly about Brut, but also a bit about hardware synthesizers and [looptober](https://bandwagon.fm/68e6bf0df1f8302aa576c863).

If you want to know about more about why Brut exists or its philisophical underpinnings, check it out!
