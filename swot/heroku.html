                        There is a BIG difference in creating an RDS instance and a Heroku Postgres instance, and Heroku absolutely nails providing a mature featureset and configuration for all of their offerings.  "A web app with a database and some caching" is super common and when you run the three commands needed to set that up, you have something mature, scalable, secure, and reliable.  All without having to know how the underlying infrastructure is managed.
                      </p>
                    
                      <p class="measure lh-copy center">
                        The router and Logplex are incredibly mature and featureful.  Creating these sorts of things in AWS is not easy and not cheap.  Logging alone can eat up quite a bit of time and money and with Heroku it's just there and just works.
                      </p>
                    
                      <p class="measure lh-copy center">
                        If you think the value Heroku provides is git-based deploys, you are very, very wrong. When Stitch Fix migrated away from Heroku due to our scale<sup>&dagger;</sup>, I led the team that did that migration to AWS.  Just handling the small number of use cases we had required a lot of decision-making, a lot of tuning, and a lot of care to set it up.  The team was three engineers and that was too lean.
                      </p>
                    
                      <p class="measure lh-copy center">
                        Observing this process is a great way to understand the true value of Heroku. You get properly configured, properly monitored, high-performing infrastructure without having to make hardly <strong>any</strong> decisions.  And a huge team that supports it.

                        <sup>&dagger;</sup><span class="f7">The very short explanation is that we needed Private Spaces and it was in beta at the time and extremely limited. The way we'd designed our systems just wouldn't work with the way Private Spaces worked at that time.  If Private Spaces had shipped earlier or Stitch Fix was starting now, I'm confident we could've used Private Spaces and would still be on it now. The platform performed well and there was never a thought that we'd get better performance by migrating.</span>

                        If you look at true cost of ownership, which includes the people and expertise needed to run your own infra as well as all the opportunity costs and carrying costs of doing so, Heroku is a far better deal than AWS for small-to-medium sized teams, and possibly even for larger teams, depending on the workload.

                        Having a solid foundation of feature-rich tools, supported by a large and responsive team is a helluva lot for $7/month per dyno.  Once you start running your own infra, you'll need at least a three-person ops team for redundancy and upkeep, and the defaults for analogous AWS services are FAR from on par with Heroku's defaults—you need to know AWS deeply to get parity. Oh, and you have to shell out for Enterprise support from AWS, because that's the only way to get your questions answered.

Every ticket, no matter how insignificant, from customers that are probably not generating margin, gets answered and answered deeply.  They can and will escalate issues to the actual engineers on the products in order to get your question answered.  This is not common at their scale.  AWS Enterprise support is not this good…at all.

                        Heroku Postgres is best of breed, super mature, highly performant and easy to use and manage.  I was very happy when they added their own Redis, because it means that you can have the majority of the infra you need provided and supported by Heroku.  In particular, both datastores allow automated credential rotation, which is a feature that <strong>many</strong> SaaS companies do not provide.

                        Private Spaces, HIPAA, and several other features useful for anyone—not just big companies—require an enterprise agreement and sales calls.  I would be surprised if there is a technical reason that is true, so this means that any company willing to sign a BAA without sales calls has potential to eat marketshare.

It's extremely hard to predict infrastructure needs while growing, but the Heroku Enterprise process requires yearly commitments to do so (or it did they last time I interacted with it—how their Enterprise offering works at all is completely hidden).

                        Heroku suffers from first mover advantage, having built their own kinda-Docker-like-thing called buildpacks.  While they have tried to get traction with that concept by open-sourcing it, Docker/containers currently dominate the rest of the world.

                        Heroku Scheduler seems to have not been touched since 2013.  It is not reliable and does not scale.  There is no guarantee that your jobs will run on time or at all (and they don't always), and there is no way to observe its behavior or get errors. The web UI completely fails to scale because it truncates the commands and doesn't allow sorting.  And you have to convert everything to UTC.

                        In the Common Runtime, all data stores (Postgres, Redis) are available over the Internet, protected by a password.

                        Most developers think Heroku is toy.  It is not. I met with a junior dev at a startup who was setting up fucking <strong>ECS</strong> to run his tiny app that was in beta and serving < 100 users.  He thought Heroku was not a serious consideration. I told him that Stitch Fix almost went public on Heroku and that it would absolutely work for his use-case.  I asked him to give a try.  He later told me that after an hour he had migrated everything from AWS to Heroku…and was very happy about it.

I realize legacy enterprises have tons of money, but there is an entire generation of developers who will be leaders and decision makers in a few years who think Heroku is a toy.  The fact is, a team can go from startup to going concern on Heroku and this is not something Heroku successfully promotes.

Why does the homepage say nothing about what Heroku actually is or does?  Perhaps the startup market isn't large, but it is by definition growing.  Successful startups become big companies. Unsuccesful ones mint engineers who will make decisions at their next job and you want them choosing Heroku.

                        Manually examining a staging app and clicking a deploy button is not the best way to ensure the quality of code to be deployed.  But it's easy to understand and set up.  A much better approach are so-called "canary" deploys where your new code runs alongside the old and has limited traffic routed to it.

                        Render are making a product very similar to Heroku, and they have the second-movers advantage of being able to build on     more modern infra.  They also can essentially cut off the enterprise product by offering it self-serve. Now, it could be that for reasons I'm not aware of,  Render are <strong>also</strong> doomed to an Oracle acquisition and enterprise phone calls, but this isn't guaranteed.

                        Render could, if they wanted, position themselves as <em>the</em> PAAS for startups. This would leave Heroku with lucrative but uninspiring legacy enterprise clients only. They'd eventually fade away into a tiny little feature blurb on Salesforce's webpage.

                        These companies aren't constrained by Salesforce and they are captializing on current fashion trends in app development.  That means they are getting developer mindshare and, when the JAMStack lie comes crashing down, will probably be a in good position to expand their offerings.  Imagine if Netlify launched a managed GraphQL backed by a real database like Postgres.  Suddenly, they become a platform for a <em>ton</em> of developers to deploy apps backed by a powerful datastore that can be integrated into any backend.

                        The addition of the various Pipelines features made me extremely worried for  Heroku's roadmap. To be honest, this is probably the single biggest indicator that they are targeting entrenched legacy customers, because no modern deploy pipeline should have manual buttons to push to promote code.  Heroku should be modeling a better way to do things, not acquiring carrying cost operationalizing outmoded concepts.

                      <p class="measure lh-copy center">
                        This is a threat because they must support these features as they grow and expand their product.  I can't imagine anyone is enthused about this, and it's confusing at best for new customers.  I mean, they have freakin' <strong>staging</strong> listed as part of a "continuous delivery workflow".  Yech.
